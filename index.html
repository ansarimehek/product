        PORSCHE
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Porsche brand has left its mark throughout its over 70 year history, becoming known for its stunning
        timeless
        designs and pursuit to seamlessly merge style and substance. Ferdinand Porsche strived to create the perfect car
        inside
        and out, refusing to compromise power for style.
        Technically, yes. Porsche and Volkswagen merged in 2011. At that time, Porsche was designated a subsidiary of
        Volkswagen AG (interestingly, besides being the Porsche parent company, VW also owns Audi, Bugatti, and
        Lamborghini).
        So, from that standpoint, Volkswagen AG is the company who owns Porsche.
        Porsche is a German automobile manufacturer known for producing high-performance sports cars, SUVs, and sedans. 
        Porsche vehicles are renowned for their exceptional features and high-quality craftsmanship, reflecting the brand's commitment to engineering excellence and performance.

    <P>For the design of the Porsche logo, Franz drew inspiration from Stuttgart's city seal, which features a rearing
        horse, and incorporated this into the centre of the shield shape. Since Stuttgart itself was founded around
        950AD as
        a centre of horse-breeding and stud farms, the animal was a fitting addition to the emblem.
        Since its founding in 1931, Porsche has risen to become one of the most renowned luxury car brands globally. If
        you
        visit us at Porsche Tysons Corner, you will be met by sleek sports cars, grand touring cars, and SUVs with
        precisely
        engineered performance, innovative technology, and Porsche's legendary iconic style.
        Overall, Porsche vehicles combine performance, luxury, and craftsmanship to deliver a driving experience that is both exhilarating and refined, making them highly sought after by automotive enthusiasts around the world.
        Porsche offers a diverse range of products beyond just automobiles. While the core of their business remains focused on designing and manufacturing high-performance sports cars, the brand has expanded its offerings to include various other products and services.
