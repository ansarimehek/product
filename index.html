    <h1>PORSCHE</h1>
    <br>
    The Porsche brand has left its mark throughout its over 70 year history, becoming known for its stunning timeless designs and pursuit to seamlessly merge style and substance. Ferdinand Porsche strived to create the perfect car inside and out, refusing to compromise power for style.</br>
        <br> Technically, yes. Porsche and Volkswagen merged in 2011. At that time, Porsche was designated a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG (interestingly, besides being the Porsche parent company, VW also owns Audi, Bugatti, and Lamborghini). So, from that standpoint, Volkswagen AG is the company who owns Porsche.</br>

    <P>For the design of the Porsche logo, Franz drew inspiration from Stuttgart's city seal, which features a rearing horse, and incorporated this into the centre of the shield shape. Since Stuttgart itself was founded around 950AD as a centre of horse-breeding and stud farms, the animal was a fitting addition to the emblem.
        Since its founding in 1931, Porsche has risen to become one of the most renowned luxury car brands globally. If you visit us at Porsche Tysons Corner, you will be met by sleek sports cars, grand touring cars, and SUVs with precisely engineered performance, innovative technology, and Porsche's legendary iconic style.
